Hasami shogi (はさみ将棋 hasami shōgi, "sandwiching chess") is a variant of shogi (Japanese chess). Unlike other shogi variants, it has only one type of piece and is won by capturing all but one of the opponent's pieces.

Two players, Black and White (or 先手 sente and 後手 gote), play on a shogi board, or one-quarter of a Go board – a grid of 9 ranks (rows) by 9 files (columns). The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color. Each player has a set of 9 wedge-shaped pieces or pawns (foot soldiers). Each pawn has its name in the form of two Japanese characters marked on its face (歩兵). On the reverse side of each pawn is the abbreviated character for tokin (と), often in a different color (e.g., red instead of black). Black plays with pawns and White plays with tokins.
